Please do not merge this, I just didn't know any other way to get a message to the founders of OpenTF right away.  And also inform the community.  
  
Hashicorp is nearing the two year mark of their IPO (Nov 2021).  It appears as though their capital investors (see https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2021/12/09/hashicorp-shares-rise-in-latest-open-source-ipo-minting-new-billionaire/?sh=d9449f625d7b) may be wanting money and Hashicorp may not have met their expectations.  This leads me to think the board is being forced to raise value (possibly for a sell off?).  This may be what is driving the switch in Licensing models.  I present the following reason for this speculation (this is not financial advice, and all the other legaleze, blah blah).  
  
Their share has dropped from the opening value of ~$80/HCP to ~$25/HCP which seems to be holding fairly consistantly.  There was a sharp uptick over the summer ~$26 -> ~$35.5.  And then a sudden drop on June 8th back down to ~$25.  This says to me there were some internal conversations over the summer, something leaked to market insiders, and then some people cashed out a little.  
  
With the recent Red Hat fiasco, it may be wise to be on alert to these type of changes in the market for anything that is a publicly traded company. It's possible capital investors are not confident in the market (https://www.ey.com/en_us/growth/venture-capital/q2-2023-venture-capital-investment-trends) or are just trying to free up capital for the next investment.  Either way, they are driving these types of decision.  
  
Another thing to point out, the list of investors may include GitHub.  This may be a good reason to duplicate the repo onto another platform.  I enjoy GitHub, but when there are strong financial ties like that, it may be a wise idea to "make a backup just in case".  I'm not saying GitHub will do anything to the repo.  I'm just suggesting avoiding any potential fiscal conflict.
